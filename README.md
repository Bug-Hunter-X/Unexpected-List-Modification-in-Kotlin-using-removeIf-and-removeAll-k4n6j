This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Kotlin when working with mutable lists. The functions `removeIf` and `removeAll` modify the original list, which can be counter-intuitive compared to the `filter` function, which returns a new list without modifying the original.  The example code illustrates this difference, showing how easy it is to make a mistake if you're not carefully considering the intended behavior.
